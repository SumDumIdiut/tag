# A non-simulated puppet for a player in a networked match -- no physics, no
# movement code, just interpolates toward whatever position the server last
# reported. Used uniformly for every player, the local one included: no
# client-side prediction happens anywhere anymore, so every avatar is purely
# a rendering of confirmed server state. That trades instant local
# responsiveness for input lag equal to round-trip time, in exchange for the
# render never needing a correction/snap.
